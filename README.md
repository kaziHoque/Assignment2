My app is a 15 min chat web application.It firstly takes the user name on the first page.
Then takes conversation name on the second page.Then a chat interface pops up filled with the username and conversation name.
Multiple users can join in on real time and chat with one another.If someone is typing, it will show that 'X is typing...'
At the end of 15 mins, the chat session will end and will be saved in the database.
Can start new session.
